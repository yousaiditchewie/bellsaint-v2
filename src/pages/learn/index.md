<br><br><br><br>With a unique sound that blends nostalgia with modern ferocity, BELLSAINT is a bold force of nature. Throughout her music career, she consistently returns to her earlier influences like Johnny Cash, Stevie Nicks, and ABBA. 

The Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter Caroline Brooks (BELLSAINT) was born in Tyler, Texas, and started getting lead roles in kindergarten musicals when she was 5. She started playing piano when she was 7 and began taking classical voice lessons at age 13. As a Radio-TV-Film major at the University of Texas at Austin, she moved to Los Angeles and started making a name for herself as an in-demand singer/songwriter. 

After performing at the Sundance Film Festival in 2014, she signed with management company Primary Wave and subsequently collaborated on songs with artists including Natalie Imbruglia, Charlotte Lawrence, Sophie Simmons, Cloves, and The Script. She also collaborated with renowned producer/songwriters Giorgio Moroder (Daft Punk), Paul Williams (David Bowie, Daft Punk), David Hodges (Kelly Clarkson, Christina Aguilera) and Rob Kleiner (Sia, Labrinth). Her music has been placed in various commercials, including a Volkswagen Super Bowl commercial, Adidas commercial, Marc Jacobs ad, and video games like Just Dance and Life is Strange. Her music has also been featured in various trailers and popular TV shows like Little Fires Everywhere, Riverdale, Pretty Little Liars, Shameless, The Handmaid’s Tale, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Famous in Love, Younger, Don Mancini’s Chucky, Good Trouble, The Hills, Waco: The Aftermath, The Good Doctor, and The Vampire Diaries. Her first EP, Technicolor Dream, won an Independent Music Award for Best Pop EP and her song Can’t Stop a Woman won for best Adult Contemporary song.

As a performer, she’s shared the stage with artists such as Lord Huron, Alec Benjamin, The Lone Bellow, Ocean Park Standoff, and the Warbly Jets. She’s also garnered praise from such outlets as The New York Times, Refinery29, Extra, Elle, Galore Magazine, and Us Weekly, the latter of whom called her their “favorite new artist.” Her collaboration with Klergy, “Walk Through Fire,” reached No. 8 on Billboard’s Top TV Songs Chart after it aired in the hit show Riverdale.

When she’s not writing or recording music, BELLSAINT is doing her part to inspire future generations of female artists. She volunteers as a coach at L.A.’s Rock n’ Roll Camp for Girls and teaches songwriting to youth at the non-profit program Awaken Arts. In addition, profits from her cover of “Losing my Religion” were donated to the National Center for Victims of Crime.
