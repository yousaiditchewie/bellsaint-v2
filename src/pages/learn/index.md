With a unique sound that blends nostalgia with modern ferocity, BELLSAINT is a bold force of nature in her music and advocacy. Throughout her music career, she consistently returns to her earlier influences like Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, David Byrne, Bruce Springsteen, and Stevie Nicks. 

The Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter Caroline Brooks (BELLSAINT) was born in Tyler, Texas, and started getting lead roles in musicals when she was 5. She started playing piano when she was 7 and began taking classical voice lessons at age 13. As a Radio-TV-Film major at the University of Texas at Austin, she moved to Los Angeles and started making a name for herself as an in-demand singer/songwriter. 

After performing at the Sundance Film Festival, she signed with management company Primary Wave and subsequently collaborated with artists including Natalie Imbruglia, Charlotte Lawrence, Sophie Simmons, Cloves, and The Script. She also collaborated with renowned producer/songwriters Giorgio Moroder (Daft Punk), Paul Williams (David Bowie, Daft Punk, Portugal the Man), David Hodges (Kelly Clarkson, Christina Aguilera) and Rob Kleiner (Sia, Labrinth). Her music has been placed in various commercials, including a Volkswagen Super Bowl commercial, an Adidas commercial, a Marc Jacobs ad, and video games _Just Dance_ and _Life is Strange_. Her music has also been featured in various trailers and popular TV shows including _Little Fires Everywhere_, _Riverdale_, _Shameless_, _The Handmaid’s Tale_, _The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina_, Don Mancini’s _Chucky_, _Waco: The Aftermath_, and _The Good Doctor_. Her first EP, Technicolor Dream, won an Independent Music Award for Best Pop EP and her song Can’t Stop a Woman won for best Adult Contemporary song.

Music from the 60s — a time when women were fighting to have a voice in the world—largely impacted BELLSAINT’s tone.

“The 60s were such a special time for music,” she says. “Especially counterculture waves like the Yé-yé movement \[in Southern Europe], which mainly featured angsty, playful female singers. It really reflected the resistance to authority and status quo at the time. I think a lot of musical elements from the 60s are coming back because of what’s going on in our culture and political environment right now.”

BELLSAINT also refuses to be neutral, instead opting to make bold, largely personal statements through all aspects of her music – from her artistry to her songwriting. “I came up with the name BELLSAINT because I wanted to have a genderless name nobody else had,” she says. “’Bell’ felt vulnerable and beautiful, while ‘saint’ felt strong and empowering.

Her upcoming album _i used to be funny._ is set to release October 20, 2023, and it features personal songs about love, religious trauma, and empowerment. The track list includes collaborations with Jamie Sierota (Echosmith, Adam Lambert, Jawny), Paul Williams (David Bowie, Daft Punk, Portugal the Man), Grammy-nominated songwriter Garrison Starr (Margaret Cho, Backstreet Boys), Jake Scott (Carrie Underwood, Aloe Blacc), and Bruce Wiegner (Katy Perry).

As a performer, she’s shared the stage with artists such as Lord Huron, Alec Benjamin, The Lone Bellow, Ocean Park Standoff, Katelyn Tarver, Chance Peña, Scary Pockets, and the Warbly Jets. She has also performed in various music festivals including SXSW (official showcasing artist for the Grammy Museum),

San Diego’s Lantern Street Festival, and southern California’s High School Nation Tour. She’s also garnered praise from such outlets as The New York Times, Refinery29, Extra, Elle, Galore Magazine, LADYGUNN, and Us Weekly, the latter of whom called her their “favorite new artist.” Her collaboration with Klergy, “Walk Through Fire,” reached No. 8 on Billboard’s Top TV Songs Chart after it aired in the hit show Riverdale. Her cover of “Uninvited”, featured on the Little Fires Everywhere soundtrack, debuted in Shazam’s Top Tracks 2020 Playlist. She also did a featured fashion collaboration with Club Monaco for her “Karma” music video, and has performed on iHeartRadio’s Dunkin’ Latte Lounge, MIX 94.1 Vegas, DASH Radio, NBC’s Daytime, NYC’s PIX11 News, and Los Angeles’ KTLA.

When she’s not writing or recording music, BELLSAINT is doing her part to inspire future generations of creatives. She volunteers as a music coach at L.A.’s Rock n’ Roll Camp for Girls, and teaches songwriting as a therapeutic tool for at-risk youth at the non-profit program Awaken Arts. In addition, profits from her cover of “Losing my Religion” were donated to the National Center for Victims of Crime, and she has donated use of her songs to She Is The Music, a non-profit program that promotes equality, inclusivity, and opportunity for young women interested in pursuing careers in music that would otherwise not have access.
