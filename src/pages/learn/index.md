With a sound reminiscent of a modern-day Nancy Sinatra meets The Black Keys, this Los Angeles-based siren is on the edge of becoming a household name. Having released powerhouse singles debuting all over the media, there are exciting things on the horizon for this alt-pop rising star originally from Texas.

Having been heavily influenced by Nancy Sinatra, Johnny Cash, & Queen, BELLSAINT (Caroline Brooks) began polishing her craft and earned her stripes writing for other artists, including Natalie Imbruglia and The Script’s Danny O’Donoghue. In time, she collaborated with renowned producer/songwriters Giorgio Moroder (Daft Punk), Paul Williams (David Bowie, Daft Punk), David Hodges (Kelly Clarkson, Christina Aguilera), & Rob Kleiner (Sia, Andra Day, Britney Spears, David Guetta), and had songs placed in a Volkswagen Super Bowl commercial, an Adidas ad, as well as popular TV shows like _Riverdale_, _Shameless_, _Rise_, _The Vampire Diaries_, _Pretty Little Liars_, _Famous In Love_, _The Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina_, and Tyler Perry's film _Boo 2! A Madea Halloween_.

Her haunting cover of REM’s "Losing My Religion" reached #1 on Hype Machine and earned her plenty of industry and blog buzz, gaining love from Extra, Refinery29, Elle, Galore Magazine, and prompted Us Weekly to call BELLSAINT their favorite new artist.

For her recent single "Karma", she collaborated with clothing brand Club Monaco for the official music video, and garnered enthusiastic buzz for the song as well as the fashion.

_"_Karma" was listed at #6 on Elle’s "Best Songs of 2018 (So Far)," and Refinery29 listed her at #3 for "Best Song Lyrics of 2018"_._ This caused her fanbase to spread even more rapidly.

She performed as an official SXSW showcasing artist for the grammy museum in 2017, and in 2018 went on a week-long tour in southern california opening for recording artist Silentó.

Always conscious of giving back (proceeds from "Losing My Religion" are being donated to the National Center for Victims of Crime), BELLSAINT spends her spare time volunteering as a coach at LA's Rock n' Roll Camp for Girls and teaching songwriting to at-risk youth girls at Awaken Arts.
